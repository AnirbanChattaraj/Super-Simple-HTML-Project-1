# Super Simple HTML Project - 1

This is my very first HTML-only project. 🚀  

## 📌 Pages
- **Home (index.html)** → Basic introduction
- **About (about.html)** → Details about me & my skills
- **Contact (contact.html)** → Contact form

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- HTML5 (no CSS/JS yet)

## 🎯 Purpose
- Practice HTML structure
- Learn semantic tags (`header`, `main`, `footer`, `article`, `aside`, `nav`)
- Push project to GitHub

✨ This is Project 1 of my daily learning journey.  
Next projects will gradually include **HTML + CSS, then JavaScript**.
